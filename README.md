REST PKI NG client lib for PHP
===========================
**Standard version for PHP 5.5 or greater**
 
This library contains classes that encapsulate the calls to the REST PKI NG API.

The recommended way to install **Rest PKI Core Client lib** is through [Composer](http://getcomposer.org):

    "require": {
        "lacuna/restpkicore-client" : "^0.0.1"
    }

This library depends on the GuzzleHttp package, which in turn requires PHP 5.5 or greater.
